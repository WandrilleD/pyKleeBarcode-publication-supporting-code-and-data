This repository contains the code and data of the experiments performed in our manuscript (currently under review) presenting 
[pyKleeBarcode](https://github.com/WandrilleD/pyKleeBarcode).

The bash scripts (numeroted 01 to 04) generate indicator vectors and structure matrices for the different experiment.
Scripts 01 to 03 should take around 1 minute each to run. Script 04 should take around 1 hour because of the random replicates.

The jupyter notebooks (numeroted 05 to 07) use the generate indicator vectors and structure matrices to create the figures of our manuscript, and should take a couple of minutes each to run.
